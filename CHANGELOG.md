    - You must be using the v2 configuration format introduced in 1.0.0.
    - `fail_fast` defaults to `false`.
    - #240 issue by @Lucas-C.

    - #617 PR by @asottile.

1.0.1 - 2017-09-07
==================

### Fixes
- Fix a regression in the return code of `pre-commit autoupdate`
    - `pre-commit migrate-config` and `pre-commit autoupdate` return 0 when
      successful.
    - #614 PR by @asottile.

1.0.0 - 2017-09-07
==================
pre-commit will now be following [semver](https://semver.org/).  Thanks to all
of the [contributors](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/graphs/contributors)
that have helped us get this far!

### Features

- pre-commit's cache directory has moved from `~/.pre-commit` to
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pre-commit` (usually `~/.cache/pre-commit`).
    - `pre-commit clean` now cleans up both the old and new directory.
    - If you were caching this directory in CI, you'll want to adjust the
      location.
    - #562 issue by @nagromc.
    - #602 PR by @asottile.
- A new configuration format for `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is introduced which
  will enable future development.
    - The new format has a top-level map instead of a top-level list.  The
      new format puts the hook repositories in a `repos` key.
    - Old list-based configurations will continue to be supported.
    - A command `pre-commit migrate-config` has been introduced to "upgrade"
      the configuration format to the new map-based configuration.
    - `pre-commit autoupdate` now automatically calls `migrate-config`.
    - In a later release, list-based configurations will issue a deprecation
      warning.
    - An example diff for upgrading a configuration:

    ```diff
    +repos:
     -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
         sha: v0.9.2
         hooks:
    ```
    - #414 issue by @asottile.
    - #610 PR by @asottile.

  for a file by running `identify-cli filename`.
